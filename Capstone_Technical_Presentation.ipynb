    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### GOAL:\n",
    "Discover the distribution of landscape suitability for Piping Plovers across the Great Lakes region of the USA? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics:\n",
    "What are the landscape metrics associated with Piping Plover observation locations in this region?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Audience: \n",
    "To help environmental managers determine habitat characteristics and locations for nesting Piping Plovers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources:\n",
    "The eBird Reference Dataset Version 2016.\n",
    "Great Lakes Coastal Wetlands Consortium\n",
    "Features derived using ArcGIS software\n",
    "Scientific Journals for domain knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Findings:\n",
    "The project discovered key physical landscape features that are associated with Piping Plover sightings. Namely distance from shorelines are ideally betweek 50m and 150m, and there is a preference for sandy shorelines. The logistic regression model\n",
    "is able to predict locations better than the mean baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions and Risks:\n",
    "The project is still a work in progress, and further refinement of the model is required. \n"
